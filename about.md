I'm Nikolay Karpov, I'm a software developer. I value fulfilling work and do my best to produce the best software I can. I'm trying to write clean code, which wouldn't cause suffering of a maintainer. I look for a deeper meaning of my job, not just a payroll and a comfortable workplace.

I work mostly in Java, used to write code in C/C++.
